## Key Terms

**Prelude**  

An introductory piece. 

**Fugue**  

Systematized imitative polyphony, or more specifically, a polyphonic composition for a fixed number of instrumental lines or voices (usually 3 or 4) built on a single principal theme (**subject**) that is imitated in all of the voices. The form consists of alternating sections, those that have the subject and those that don’t (**episodes**). 

**Binary form** 

Common structure for dance music or other types of instrumental music in the Baroque. A two-part structure in which each part is repeated. 

   |: a :||: b :|  OR  a   a  b  b  

**Suite** 

A composition inspired by dance music. This multi-movement work references different musical characteristics of dances in each movement. A suite cannot accompany actual dancing; it is music for listening. 

**Sonata** (genre)  

It is one of the two major instrumental genres of the Baroque. A work for one instrument is called a solo sonata.  

**Trio Sonata**  

A type of Baroque sonata featuring two high-range instruments (usually playing in imitation) + basso continuo 

**Basso continuo**  

Bass line played by an instrument that can also play chords, such as a keyboard (organ, harpsichord) or lute. Other instruments, such as a cello, might play the bass line as well. Instruments playing the bass line in a Baroque composition are referred to as the continuo.
