**Charles Shadle** (1960–)

### "A Late Walk" by Robert Frost

"A Late Walk" for voice and piano. Ryan Turner, tenor and Charles Shadle, piano.

Here is the text:

When I go up through the mowing field,   
     The headless aftermath,   
Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,   
     Half closes the garden path.

And when I come to the garden ground,   
     The whir of sober birds   
Up from the tangle of withered weeds   
     Is sadder than any words.

A tree beside the wall stands bare,   
     But a leaf that lingered brown,   
Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,   
     Comes softly rattling down.

I end not far from my going forth   
     By picking the faded blue   
Of the last remaining aster flower   
     To carry again to you.
