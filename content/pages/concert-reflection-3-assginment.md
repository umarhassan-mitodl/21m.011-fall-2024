Some tips, ranked:

1\. You can group pieces or movements together; however, you must attend the whole concert and write about all of the music on the concert, using the terminology we have been studying in this class.

You do not need to analyze this music, but if you hear specific melodies, instrumentation, or other important elements return within a movement or work, make note of that.

Be aware of your own attitudes, feelings, etc., as you are listening. For example, were you excited about coming to this concert or were you unsure of what to expect?

2\. The first paragraph of your reflection should include the details of the concert: who performed; what pieces were performed; where it was performed, including whether you attended in person or online; and when it was performed. If there was a particular reason you chose this concert (wanted to hear a particular piece or performer, free tickets, going with friends, etc.), the first paragraph is a good place to include this as well.

In giving the who-what-where-when details, use the first and last name of the composer(s) and performer(s). Then in the rest of the reflection, refer to the composer(s) and performer(s) by last name. 

If any aspect of the venue impressed you, the first paragraph is a good place to include that as well.

The third reflection is longer to allow you to follow any of the following paths:

1. Spend more time discussing a work (or, at most, two) from the concert.
2. Compare the repertoire of this concert with those of the previous two concerts.
3. Delve more deeply into how one or more particular works on the concert relates to music we have studied in the class.
4. Offer your ideas about the pros and cons of online and live concerts. Did one format appeal to you more than the other? Explore your preference, positioned within your values as a concert goer.
