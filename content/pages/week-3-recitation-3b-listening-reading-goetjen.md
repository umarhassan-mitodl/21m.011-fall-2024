## Textures in Sacred and Secular Genres in the Renaissance

In this class, we will examine how texture is used in both sacred and secular genres in the Renaissance. In Lecture 4, we will discuss the Renaissance Mass setting. But here, we will revisit some other genres from the Medieval period, including the motet and chanson, to see how Renaissance composers approached these genres. In addition, we will learn about a new secular genre, the frottola. In each of these, the relationship of texture to words is paramount for expressing meaning and emotion in Renaissance music.

### Motet

We have already encountered the motet genre in the Medieval period in lecture 2 and section 2a. In that period, it could often come across as an obscure intellectual exercise with isorhythms and multiple texts which created dense polyphonic textures. However, in the Renaissance period, changes in texture filtered into the motet. Greater use of **homophony** (a texture with one melody where all other parts sing in harmony with the melody, aligning more or less exactly in terms of rhythm but singing different pitches) as well as **imitative polyphony** (a kind of polyphony where the voices imitate each other, alternating singing the same melody at different times) made for much clearer textures and intelligibility of words. Gone is the polytextual motet; instead, one single text is sung by all voices so that it can be clearly understood. Our example is by the Flemish composer Josquin des Prez (ca. 1450/55–1521).

Much of Josquin’s biography is opaque and musicologists have spent decades attempting to sort it out, with details being constantly revised as new evidence comes to light. But we do know that Josquin became quite well-known during his lifetime and was the first composer whose influence remained in a significant way after his death. Partly, this is due to the invention of the moveable type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440. This began a flurry of music printing into the 16th century. Many of Josquin’s works were published by the Italian printer Ottaviano Petrucci. In fact, Josquin’s fame was so great that many works were published under his name that he did not actually compose, since they would likely be more well received and sell more publications that way. This has made sifting through the works attributed to him difficult, as there are many which have traditionally been attributed to him but which he likely did not compose.

Josquin’s motet "Ave Maria…Virgo serena" (1485) is an example of a Marian motet, or a work dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It became one of the most popular motets in the 16th century, partly due to its inclusion as the first piece in the first printed and published volume of motets. Like the “Agnus Dei” example from Josquin’s *Pange lingua* Mass we will discuss in lecture 4, there is extensive use of **imitation** creating a texture of **imitative polyphony**. Listen especially for the imitation in the opening of this motet (although it can be found throughout), as each of the four voices enters in succession on the same melody (though starting on different pitches). These imitated melodies are called **points of imitation**.

In addition, Josquin also alternates here between polyphony and homophony. As in his mass settings, Josquin here chooses to highlight certain parts of the text with homophony, while otherwise using imitative polyphony throughout. As you listen, see if you can find the moments of homophony where all the voices come together in rhythmic alignment even as they sing in harmony on different pitches.

Follow along with the text and translation below as you listen. There are seven stanzas to the text and the music is organized according to these stanzas, frequently with a cadence at the end of each. In addition, at the beginning of stanza 5, there is a change in meter from duple to triple, which reverts to the original meter at the end of that stanza. So Josquin is using not only texture but meter to highlight certain parts of the text.

### Chanson

The polyphonic chanson continued to be a popular secular genre into the 15th and 16th centuries. Like the motet, the chanson also changed according to the changing use of textures in the Renaissance. Furthermore, it gained a closer connection between music and text—as did many genres in the Renaissance—than it had in the chansons of Machaut, for instance. Finally, the *formes fixes* began to erode and become much less *fixes* and in some cases not used at all. One of the most prominent composers of chansons (more than 250) in the Renaissance was Clément Janequin (c. 1485–1558).

Along with Claudin de Sermisy, Janequin developed the Parisian chanson (based in but not exclusive to Paris), which was often programmatic, meaning it expressed in the music a representation of something outside the music. For instance, Janequin’s chanson *La bataille* is a musical representation of the sounds of battle. As with Josquin, his fame was partly due to the increase in music printing in this period. Many of his works were published by the Parisian printer Pierre Attaingnant. Unusually for the time, Janequin never held a permanent position at a major church or court. Rather, he moved frequently through many jobs in both areas throughout his life. While he spent time in multiple French cities, the majority was spent in Paris, which is the setting for the chanson example below.

Among Janequin’s programmatic chansons, “Les Cris de Paris” is one of the most entertaining, if not his most popular. It functions as a musical representation of daily life in the bustling city of 15th century Paris. While still using the same kinds of alternating homophonic and polyphonic textures as Josquin’s motet, this chanson also includes musical representations of street vendors including a wine merchant, a turnip seller, and a duo who sell pears, spinach, and sorrel. The piece begins with the full ensemble asking the listener *Voulez ouyr les cris de Paris*, (“Would you like to hear the cries of Paris?”). At the end, after presenting many of these cries, the ensemble sings *Si vous en voulez plus ouyr, allez les donc querre* (“If you wish to hear more, go and fetch them.”).

Beyond the humor and wit in the text and its musical representation, the Parisian chanson features a clear-cut, primarily homophonic texture (with polyphony in this case reserved mostly for the cries). When in homophony, the typically lyrical melody is generally in the top voice (the superius). Follow along with the text and translation below and listen for the “cris de Paris”.

### Frottola

While French composers of secular polyphony like the chanson were abandoning the *formes fixes*, Italian composers in the 15th century were reviving secular polyphony in the Italian language with a return to fixed forms of their own. The **frottola** genre appears in the 1490s primarily in the aristocratic courts of Northern Italy (e.g., Mantua, Ferrara, and Urbino). Although this secular polyphony was clearly a court genre with all the formality and ritual that came with that association, it also had connections to ideas of rural, rustic, and lower-class aesthetics. In a way, it was the aristocracy taking a (sometimes condescending) interest in the culture of the common people. Often, the frottola has humorous texts and even sexual double entendres. Yet the textures present are quite similar to Janequin’s chanson: mostly homophonic, with polyphony used in particular places.

Like many other Franco-Flemish composers in the 15th century, Josquin spent some time in Italy and composed music in Italian. Our example of the frottola is his piece “El Grillo” (The Cricket). It was composed likely sometime in the 1490s, and published in 1505 by Petrucci. Josquin may have intended it to poke fun at his colleague at the court in Milan, the singer Carlo Grillo. Like Janequin’s chanson, there are onomatopoetic parts that musically mimic other sounds. In addition, it contains thinly veiled double entendres when the text says “He can sing very long, he sings all the time,” or “When the heat is very fierce, then he sings only for love.” Perhaps Carlo Grillo was both a good singer as well as an enthusiastic lover.

[Here is an image of a 16th-century publication of this piece](https://victoria.uma.es/varios/orig/Josquin-El_Grillo.orig.pdf), from a partbook (a book where each part is notated separately, but there is no full score of all the parts together). The first page shows the superius (the highest part) and the tenor part, the second page shows altus (alto) and basius (bass).

The form of this frottola is broadly ABA, but there are parts repeated within each section. The most notable elements musically are 1) the nearly universal homophony, 2) often fast notes on the same pitch, perhaps representing the sound of a cricket, and 3) the bouncing rhythms that give it both an energy as well as a humorous quality. Follow along with the text and translation below as you listen:

## Discussion Questions

1. What is the primary texture in these Renaissance pieces? How do these composers use texture for expressive purposes?
2. How do these Renaissance pieces differ from the Medieval works we looked at in terms of the relationship of text and music? Is there a greater connection between them?
3. What similarities are there between sacred and secular polyphony in the Renaissance? How are they different?
