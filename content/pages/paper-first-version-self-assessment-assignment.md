After letting your paper “sit” for several days, reread your paper and write an assessment of it (~200 words), identifying places that you feel need to be shortened, expanded, or amended to convey your ideas more effectively. In other words, where would you edit for content, flow, and clarity? There will be time to work on this in class recitations.
