## Listening

### Giuseppe Verdi, beginning of Act 1 of *La Traviata* (opera)

Recall from week 5:

**Opera**

A story or drama presented in music. It is sung throughout using two techniques for conveying the text: 

1. Recitative (think “recitation”)

- declaiming words musically in a heightened, theatrical manner  
- moves the action of the story forward 

1. Aria

- elaborate, extended piece for solo singer  
- pauses the action in order to immerse the audience in the character’s feelings

#### Excerpts: 

"Dell'invito trascorsa è già l'ora" and  "Libiamo ne'lieti calici" performed by Opera Nova w Bydgoszczy Orchestra. {{% resource_link "5b3cee73-d934-46fd-a372-b25ffc38d4f3" "\[Watch on YouTube\]" %}}
