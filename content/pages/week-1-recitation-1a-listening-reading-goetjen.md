## Introductions and Musical Terminology

In our first meeting this week, we will spend some time getting to know each other and going over the requirements for the course. Then, we will go over some basic musical terminology that you will be using this semester. We will go over these definitions together in class and, depending on time, listen to some examples and work together on applying these terms to what we hear. Going forward, you will have regular assignments to read and listen to before we meet for recitation. These will also require brief responses to discussion questions before we meet; however, for this first meeting, you do not need to submit anything.
