IN YOUR DISCUSSION POST: For ONE movement of the Haydn symphony and EITHER the Mozart OR the Garcia: Think about the musical element do you hear as the most prominent (pick only one!) and write a brief description (a sentence or two) that describes that element in the context of the piece. Next, consider how that element interacts with at least one other musical element, and share your observations in a sentence or two. For example, you may hear the melody as the most prominent and could then discuss how the melody relates to the texture, the harmony, or the form. Be sure to identify which work you are describing. 

Remember that musical elements include the following: 

- Melody (pitch)  
- Rhythm/beat/meter  
- Timbre / tone color (Instrumentation, including the human voice) 
- Texture (monophonic, polyphonic) 
- Harmony (more than one sonority sounding simultaneously. Here you can think about whether the  simultaneous sonorities sound consonant or dissonant to your ear.) 
- Form
- Articulation (how the performers are playing a line, such as sound short and separated (staccato) or long and connected (legato))
