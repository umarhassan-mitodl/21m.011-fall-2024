## Key Terms

**Vespers**  

A type of prayer service in the Roman Catholic Church. 

**Incipit and response** 

The opening words of a psalm or other sacred text. It is sung by a soloist as a chant, and the rest of the psalm verse (**response**) is sung by a choir or congregation. 

**Opera**  

A story or drama presented in music. It is sung throughout using two techniques for conveying the text: 

1. *Recitative* (think “recitation”)
    - declaiming words musically in a heightened, theatrical manner  
    - moves the action of the story forward 
2. *Aria*
    - elaborate, extended piece for solo singer  
    - pauses the action to immerse the audience in the character’s feeling 

**Da capo aria** 

An aria that follows a formal structure, generally A  B  A’ and features a returning instrumental section called a **ritornello**. 

**Basso continuo** (“Continuous bass”) 

Bass line played by an instrument that can also play chords, such as a keyboard (organ, harpsichord) or lute. Other instruments, such as a cello, might play the bass line as well.  

**Ground bass** 

A shorter bassline (music played in the lowest ranges of an instrumental ensemble) that is repeated to form the foundation for an aria or instrumental movement. 

**Period instruments** 

Musical instruments from the time of the composer or instruments constructed according to specifications from the time of the composer. Generally applied to instruments from before the 19th century.
