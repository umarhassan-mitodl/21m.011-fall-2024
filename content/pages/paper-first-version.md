Using the title “Organizing Sound: A Listener’s Journey,” or a similar one, construct a 1500-word essay that explores your experience with the music being studied this semester. Using your ideas from your First Impressions for Weeks 1 through 6, construct an essay that maps your experiences with this repertoire.

Begin by choosing 5-7 works or movements from your First Impressions 1-4. Be sure to include at least one work or movement from **4 of the 5 style periods** (Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, 19th-century). First Impressions 1-4 listed by style period can be found [here](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/21845/files/3758290?wrap=1).

Listen again to the works or movements you have chosen, making note of this “later listening.” Be aware of your expectations as someone familiar with the work, and include specific places in each work that you would welcome hearing again as well as any that are jarring surprises. Some other questions to consider: Are you hearing this piece differently? What factors have contributed to this change? If you are hearing this piece in the same way, how has this response been altered or deepened through growing familiarity?

Now, consider how your appreciation of or reaction to the works or movements you have chosen changed after gaining more experience with music of that era of other eras. Using your notes, think about similarities or differences in the examples you have chosen; this is a good place to include a discussion of the musical characteristics of each work or movement. These characteristics can then be used to consider your own personal preferences regarding the music you have chosen. 

Another consideration is context. Did learning about the context of a work, either culturally or musically affect your experience with it?

The opening paragraph should encapsulate your understanding of your chosen repertoire. It is easiest to write this paragraph last. The body of the essay, usually with about one paragraph for each work or movement discussed, will then elaborate on this idea, incorporating musical terminology to describe how your reaction(s) to these pieces or movements were altered or reinforced through repeated listening. The closing paragraph should briefly summarize the material discussed and offer some ideas for future consideration.

Please note that while this is an opinion paper, you need to base your opinions on specific musical characteristics and cultural context. 

A successful paper will use correct musical terminology, be organized effectively, and demonstrate competence with the fundamentals of writing (spelling, punctuation, grammar, and syntax).
