## Key Terms

**Suite**: an instrumental genre that consists of a series of *movements* (self-contained sections of a larger work) based on dance music. The music of the suite would not accompany actual dancing, but would reference the meter, tempo, and rhythmic patterns of dance music.

You will be listening to two movements from Handel's *Water Music*: Gigue and Minuet, both popular dances at this time. The Gigue and Minuet have distinctive characteristics. In your discussion post, you will be asked to identify these characteristics. Please do NOT use any outside sources for this discussion post; rely on what you are hearing!

## Listening
