Expand your paper (~300 additional words) to include one or two more works or movements from the works listed in the {{% resource_link "54d1b87f-d991-488f-ae9d-791f55513c3a" "Paper Revision and Expansion: Repertoire" %}}. Because you will not have the same luxury of time, consider how your listening process may have changed from the beginning of the semester. As you did with the other works, include a discussion of the musical characteristics as well as how the context of the work, either culturally or musically, affects your experience with it. 

Be sure to incorporate your instructor’s suggestions and your self-assessment ideas as part of your revision and remember that adding new information may affect your opening and closing paragraphs. 

And as always, a successful paper will use correct musical terminology, be organized effectively, and demonstrate competence with the fundamentals of writing (spelling, punctuation, grammar, and syntax).
