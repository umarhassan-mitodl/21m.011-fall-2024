This uses the same text as the "Haec dies" chant above, but this is an organum that features polyphony.

Polyphony: Musical texture in which more than one line of music is sung or played at the same time. 

Organum: The polyphonic section of a longer composition in which a pre-existing chant phrase is in the lowest voice called the tenor (“to hold”) and rendered in long-held note values. Above this borrowed and unmetered chant phrase, one or more new metered melodies are added.  

### Anonymous, “O mittissima / Virgo / Haec dies” (motet)

{{% resource_link "86513756-bf8c-4583-900f-ede761faacf2" "\[Listen on YouTube\]" %}}

Motet: A sacred, polyphonic composition with a Latin text.

Text: "0 mitissima-Virgo-Haec dies"

*Top voice:* 0 sweetest Virgin Mary: beg thy son to give us help and resources against the deceiving tricks of the demons and their iniquities.

*Middle voice:*  Virgin of virgins, light of lights, reformatrice of men, who bore the Lord: Through thee, 0 Mary, let grace be given, as the angel announced: Thou art a Virgin before and after.

*Lowest voice: Haec dies*

IN YOUR DISCUSSION POST: For each assigned piece, think about the musical element you hear as the most prominent (pick only one!) and write a brief description (a sentence or two) that describes that element in the context of the piece. 

Remember that musical elements include the following: 

- Melody (pitch)
- Rhythm/beat/meter 
- Timbre / tone color (Instrumentation, including the human voice) 
- Texture (monophonic, polyphonic) 
- Harmony (more than one sonority sounding simultaneously. Here you can think about whether the simultaneous sonorities sound consonant or dissonant to your ear.)
