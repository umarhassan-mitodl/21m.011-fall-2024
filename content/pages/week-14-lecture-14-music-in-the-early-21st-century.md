IN YOUR DISCUSSION POST: In one or two words, describe the mood of each piece. (The same word does not need to apply to the whole work. For example, you might think the one section is “peaceful” and another is “turbulent.”) Then, in a sentence/phrase or two, describe how the composer uses the musical elements to create the mood you have identified.
