## Key Terms

**Concerto**: Genre of instrumental music for a soloist (or small group of soloists) and larger ensemble (orchestra). If there is only one soloist, the concerto is called a concerto or solo concerto.  If there is a small group of soloists, the concerto is called a concerto grosso. Music for the larger ensemble alternates with passages for the soloist(s); this music is called the ritornello. The form of a movement (self-contained section of a larger musical structure, such as a concerto), that follows this pattern of alternating passages for orchestra and soloist is called ritornello form. The orchestra begins. Concertos typically have three movements that are distinguished in several ways, the most recognizable is tempo: fast-slow-fast.
