**Ensemble**: When using this term in relation to opera, ensemble refers to a scene in which multiple characters are singing.

Although Mozart did not originate this practice in opera, he did expand it into a complex dramatic and comic device. In this excerpt from Mozart's opera *The Marriage of Figaro* (*Le nozze di Figaro*), six characters comprise the ensemble, each singing their own feelings, sometimes alone and sometimes together. 

*Some background of the action that takes place before this scene:*

Figaro, valet to Count Almaviva, is to be married to Susanna, Countess Rosina’s maid. Susanna warns Figaro that the Count’s motives in offering them a new room next to his may not be entirely innocent. After Susanna is called away, Figaro promises to get the better of the Count.

Dr. Bartolo and Marcellina enter. Marcellina says Figaro owes her money and promised to marry her in lieu of repaying the debt. Bartolo offers to help Marcellina get the better of Figaro and the Count refuses to allow Figaro to marry Susanna until this issue is resolved.

*Plot summary for this scene from Act III:*

As the Count reflects on all that has happened, Susanna enters and promises to meet him that night. The Count, however, realizes he is being tricked and vows to force Figaro to marry Marcellina. At the trial over Figaro's failure to repay his debt to Marcellina, Don Curzio, the presider, rules in Marcellina’s favor. Figaro says he cannot pay, and cannot marry without his parents’ permission. In a startling revelation, all learn that Figaro is the lost son of Marcellina and Bartolo.

IN YOUR DISCUSSION POST: What do you think was the most surprising moment in this scene? How does music distinguish each character musically? How does the staging and movement of the characters support the action on the stage?
