## Key Terms

**Musical** **Notation**  

Systems developed for graphic representations of musical elements (pitch, rhythm, etc.)  

**Tablature** 

A system of notating music through a representation of performance actions rather than pitches. Especially applicable to string instruments: early lute music was written in tablature in which the symbols represented the position of the player’s fingers on the strings of the instrument. Similar notation is used today in popular music for guitar, ukulele, etc. Adapted tablature systems are used by some contemporary composers (from Oxford Dictionary of Music).

**Luthier** 

Someone who makes stringed instruments.
