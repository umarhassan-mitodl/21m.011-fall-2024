Remember that musical elements include the following: 

- Melody (pitch)  
- Rhythm/beat/meter  
- Timbre / tone color (Instrumentation, including the human voice) 
- Texture (monophonic, polyphonic) 
- Harmony (more than one sonority sounding simultaneously. Here you can think about whether the  simultaneous sonorities sound consonant or dissonant to your ear.) 
- Form
- Articulation (how the performers are playing a line, such as sound short and separated (staccato) or long and connected (legato))
