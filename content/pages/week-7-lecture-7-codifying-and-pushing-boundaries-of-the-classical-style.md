**III. Scherzo**

String quartet - Chamber music ensemble comprised of 2 violins, 1 viola, and 1 cello. Also, the genre of music composed for this ensemble, which usually has 4 movements. 

Scherzo - A fast movement, most often in triple meter. Composers sometimes replace a minuet in symphonies and string quartets with a scherzo. 

From 14:26–17:29: Recording by the Alban Berg Quartett. [\[Listen on YouTube\]](https://youtu.be/77-UWEluzJE?t=865)

Remember that musical elements include the following: 

- Melody (pitch)  
- Rhythm/beat/meter  
- Timbre / tone color (Instrumentation, including the human voice) 
- Texture (monophonic, polyphonic) 
- Harmony (more than one sonority sounding simultaneously. Here you can think about whether the  simultaneous sonorities sound consonant or dissonant to your ear.) 
- Form
- Articulation (how the performers are playing a line, such as sound short and separated (staccato) or long and connected (legato))
