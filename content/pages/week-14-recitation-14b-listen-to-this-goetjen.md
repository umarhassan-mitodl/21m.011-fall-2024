For this section, we will be doing a (hopefully) fun activity together in class to wrap things up and take a look back on all the music we have listened to throughout the semester. Please note: this is slightly different than what it says in the syllabus about this class, as I have a different activity that I would like to do.

There is no need to submit any discussion for this, but you should come to class on this day prepared to discuss your favorite/least favorite pieces from the semester. We will share these and make a chart together to collect some data on what each section liked and didn't like. You should also consider why you liked or didn't like these pieces and be prepared to briefly explain why for each.

Specifically, I want you to think about and choose pieces that fit three categories:

1. Your favorite piece from this class
2. Your least favorite piece from this class
3. A "sleeper" hit- a piece you liked that surprised you or it was unexpected that you liked it or which you knew nothing about ahead of time (you can interpret this in many ways)

Please choose from among any of the assigned pieces for either lecture or recitation, but you should confine your choices to assigned pieces for this class. Do not include any outside repertoire or pieces which we have tangentially discussed but which were not assigned.
