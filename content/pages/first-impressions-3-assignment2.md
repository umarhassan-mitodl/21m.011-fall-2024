title: First Impressions 4 Assignment
uid: d19a819c-c56f-453f-ba33-300a5902a192
---
When listening to any piece of music for the first time, individual impressions and reactions can range from the general to the specific. For this class, you will be asked to record your First Impressions of specific works or movements listed below.

In about 100 words, record your reactions to the works for each First Impressions assignment. The goal is to listen with an open mind and to record your honest impressions using as much musical terminology as you are able. Your work for the First Impressions will form the foundation for the Paper Project.

Take note of “where you are at” before you begin listening.  This can include, but is not limited to, your physical surroundings (time, place, with others, alone); your mindset at the time (anticipating what you will hear, fulfilling the assignment, long day/hosed, etc.); and/or your prior familiarity with the music.

Your recitation instructor may comment on your ideas; however, the grade for these assignments will be recorded as “complete” or “incomplete.” Because you will be building on knowledge and will use these First Impressions as part of the paper for this class, extensions will not be given for these assignments.

Please note: As with any performance, all the performances you will hear are interpretations. Some add video, while others are audio recordings. If there is a video component, you are welcome, but not required, to consider how the video affected your impressions of the music.
