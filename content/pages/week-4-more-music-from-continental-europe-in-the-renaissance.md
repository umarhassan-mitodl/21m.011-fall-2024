## Key Terms

**Polyphony** 

Musical texture in which more than one line of music is sung or played at the same time. Refining this description: In some instances, it may be helpful to use the term “non-imitative polyphony” rather than simply “polyphony.” 

**Homophony** 

Musical texture in which more than one line of music is sung or played at the same time; however, the rhythmic notation for all the musical lines is exactly the same or very similar. 

In other words, homophony is a subset of polyphony (many parts being sounded simultaneously) but distinguished by the rhythmic patterns used in each part. 

**Imitative** **polyphony** 

Musical texture in which more than one line of music is sung or played at the same time; however, the entrance of each part is staggered at different time intervals, such as in the round “Row, Row, Row Your Boat.” Composers can also choose to begin a section of a composition in imitative polyphony and then conclude that section with non-imitative polyphony. 

**Point of imitation** 

A short passage of imitative polyphony based on a single motive (short musical phrase). This term is used to describe the way Josquin uses motives to construct longer passages as in the “Agnus Dei” from his *Pange lingua* Mass. 

**Paraphrase**  

A compositional technique in which a pre-existing melody is used as the foundation for a new composition. The pre-existing melody can be ornamented (have notes added to it) or changed rhythmically.  

***A cappella*** (“In the chapel style”) 

Vocal performance without instrumental accompaniment.
